# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
**Instructor:** Mr. Lorenzo Sta. Maria, Data Scientist at Globe Telecom

---

## Overview
This repository aims to predict customer churn based on the lack of transactions over the past 3 months. It uses behavioral features such as **member_id**, **quantity**, **transaction_date**, and **category_name** to identify customers who are at risk of churning. It focuses on transaction behavior prior to churn to create accurate predictions.
